<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/jeswaniyogesh/Google-Prediction-API">Google-Prediction-API (Predictive Modelling) and  Python Client  (May 2015)</a></h3></li>
</section>
<p>This was an Individual project where I used Google Prediction API to train a model. The data set was of Car evaluation data based on 6 features such as doors, maint, lug_boot etc. The Class labels were Unacc, acc, good,vgood. Used a prediction API functionalities to train a Model and written a Python Script to predict new test instance on my train model. The accuracy was 99.4% on trained model.</p>

<li><h3>Text Categorization(Machine Learning) May 2015 </h3></li>
</section>

<p>Implemented Text Categorization using Naive Bayes Classifier and Boosting to increase the accuracy on Test text files. My program was able to categorize new test files given 20 class labels with an accuracy of 79.2%. As a part of Improvisation, I did Stemming, used Stop words which increased the Accuracy further to 81.4%.</p>

<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/jeswaniyogesh/Bagging-Machine-Learning-">Machine Learning(Bagging) (March 2015)</a></h3></li>
</section>

<p>Implemented Bagging using Decision Trees Classifier with different Training Data sets with replacement algorithm. Accuracy increased  from 70% to 94%. The classifier predicted good results with more number of Iterations (i.e More number of Classifiers) as Decision Trees Classifiers are Unstable Classifiers.</p>

<section>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/jeswaniyogesh/Threads-and-Semaphores-Operating-Systems-">Threads and Semaphores (Operating Systems) April 2015</a></h3></li>
</section>

<p>Implemented Work performed in Postal Service Department using Threads and Semaphores to provide Mutual exclusion. Used Java Semaphore Libraries to perform. Customers come to office to buy stamps, mail a package and mail a letter. Parallel processing is done to perform the given task.</p>


<section>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/jeswaniyogesh/Hidden-Markov-Model-Single-Layer-Perceptron-Machine-Learning-">Machine Learning(Hidden Markov) March 2015</a></h3></li>
</section>

<p>Implemented Hidden Markov Model to predict the states for a given model. Used Viterbi Coding Algorithm to get the states for a given sequence. The project was Implemented in Java.</p>



<section>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/jeswaniyogesh/Interprocess-Communication-OS-Concepts-">InterProcess Communication(Operating Systems) Feb 2015</a></h3></li>
</section>

<p>Implemented a prototype of Microprocessor in Java. The program acts as a CPU and Memory and it works and fetches information from Memory for the instructions and processes in CPU. It also has a functionality of Interrupt, Timer which will switch execution from One process to another in timely manner. The program takes a text file with loaded instructions and provides the output desired.</p>



<section>
<li><h3>Machine Learning( Neural Networks)  Feb 2015</h3></li>
</section>

<p>Implemented Neural Networks(Double Perceptron Layer Networks) to train the system with more than 90% of accuracy for test instances.</p>



<section>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/jeswaniyogesh/Decision-Trees-Machine-Learning-">Machine Learning (Decision Tree)  Feb 2015</a></h3></li>
</section>

<p>Implemented a  Decision Tree to classify the Datasets and to take Decisions on given input as a part of project in Machine Learning. Use of Entropy and Information Gain to get the best input. As a further enhancement, did Post Pruning on the tree to improve the Accuracy to get the best results.</p>


<section>
<li><h3>Java Blog Aggregator  (Dec 2014)</h3></li>
</section>

<p>Developed a Java Blog Aggregator to maintain all the blogs related to Java Development.It was a combination of  Spring Framework, Maven, Apache Tiles, JAXB, Html,CSS, Java, JSP, Servlets, Jetty Server, Hibernate, XML,Apache Tomcat Server, JSON etc. It covered all the different aspects of the technologies and gave me a good exposure to work and also to integrate it all at a place.</p>


<section>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/jeswaniyogesh/Shortest-Air-Routes-Data-Structures-">Data Structures (Dec 2014)</a></h3></li>
</section>

<p>A  project for Airline Reservation system to find the Shortest and Cheapest Flights between the cities to make customers travel more comfortable.worked on different Graph Algorithms and implemented it to use to develop a web project.</p>

<section>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/jeswaniyogesh/Online-Oil-Portal-Web-Application-">Oil Transaction (Database Design and Web Develppment (Nov 2014)</a></h3></li>
</section>

<p>Worked on the Academic Project where Clients can log in to Online Portal to make some Oil Transactions,i.e BUY/SELL on regular basis with the help of Traders. It is an Intermediate System where Clients need to pay commission to Traders for every Successful transaction. Web Development is done using HTML, CSS, Java script, PHP (Interface), MySQL, WAMP Server. </p>


<section>
<li><h3>Mobile Jammer (March 2011)</h3></li>
</section>

<p>The Project name itself speaks everything. worked on a distinguishing project called Mobile Jammer integrating Electronics with Computers on a broader scale.we created PCB circuits from scratch, worked in High Radio Frequency labs with Highly equipped Equipments, did software testing on GSM and CDMA frequencies, Jammer was able to block radio signals till 10-15 metres of distance and was remarkable.</p>
